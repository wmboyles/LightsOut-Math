	abstract = {We answer some questions concerning the so-called σ-game of Sutner [Linear cellular automata and the Garden of Eden, Math. Intelligencer11 (1989), 49–53]. It is played on a graph where each vertex has a lamp, the light of which is toggled by pressing any vertex with an edge directed to the lamp. For example, we show that every configuration of lamps can be lit if and only if the number of complete matchings in the graph is odd. In the special case of an orthogonal grid one gets a criterion for whether the number of monomer-dimer tilings of an m×n grid is odd or even.}

  abstract = {Each vertex in a simple graph is in one of two states: “on” or “off”. The set of all on vertices is called a configuration. In the σ-game, “pushing” a vertex v changes the state of all vertices in the open neighborhood of v, while in the σ+-game pushing v changes the state of all vertices in its closed neighborhood. The reachability question for these two games is to decide whether a given configuration can be reached from a given starting configuration by a sequence of pushes. We consider the lit-only restriction on these two games where a vertex can be pushed only if it is in the on state. We show that the lit-only restriction can make a big difference for reachability in the σ-game, but has essentially no effect in the σ+-game.}
